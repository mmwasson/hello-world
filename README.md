learning to use github and a repository
I'm a 52 year old, single, white, female, GIS Analyst. I am working on my master's degree in GIST. There is so much new technology to learn. It's overwhelming but I'm trying to work through it.
I'm building a house, have been at my new job almost a year, lost weight. Lots of big changes in the past year. Geez.....I'm exhausted.
